## About
Hi, I'm Mahin! I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I am focused on strengthening my data analytics skills through various courses and projects. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

During my course studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for analyzing and visualizing. I am proficient in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python, and have a good understanding of data analytics techniques including, but not limited to, data preparation, data wrangling, statistical analysis, chart design, dashboard building, process documenting, and data storytelling.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section, I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Analyzing Students' Mental Health
**Tools Used:** PostgreSQL, Power BI

**Dataset:** Mental health survey of international students in Japan

**Project Goal:** The primary objective of this project is to analyze the mental health of international students in Japan and determine how length of stay impacts depression (PHQ-9), social connectedness (SCS), and acculturative stress (ASISS) scores.

By leveraging SQL for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, we aim to identify patterns and trends in students’ mental health conditions and provide data-driven insights for universities to support student well-being.

Skills: SQL, and Power BI Skills Used

**Project Results & Insights**
- Shorter stays are linked to higher depression, suggesting adaptation challenges.
- Social connectedness plays a crucial role—students with stronger support networks have lower depression and stress levels.
- Longer stays don’t always improve mental health—some students experience increased stress over time due to academic and cultural pressures.
- Universities should focus on providing social and psychological support to international students during their early years of study.


## Analyze International Debt Statistics
**Tools Used:** Excel, PostgreSQL, Power BI

**Dataset:**

**Project Goal:** This project analyzes international debt statistics collected by The World Bank to understand debt distribution among developing countries. The objective is to identify:

- The total number of distinct countries in the dataset.
- The country with the highest total debt.
- The country with the lowest principal repayment (debt repayments).
The project is implemented using Excel for data extraction, SQL for analysis, and Power BI for interactive visualizations.

**Skills** Excel, SQL, Power BI

**Project Results & Insights**
After completing the analysis, the project provides valuable insights into international debt statistics:
Distinct Countries in the Dataset, Country with the Highest Total Debt, Country with the Lowest Principal Repayment


## Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI

**Project Goal:** In this Power BI case study, I'll investigate a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates. This case study helps to understand why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn.
