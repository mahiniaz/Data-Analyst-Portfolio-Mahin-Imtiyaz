Hi, I'm Mahin! I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I am focused on strengthening my data analytics skills through various courses and projects. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst.

During my course studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for analyzing and visualizing. I am proficient in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python, and have a good understanding of data analytics techniques including, but not limited to, data preparation, data wrangling, statistical analysis, chart design, dashboard building, process documenting, and data storytelling.
